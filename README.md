# Welcome to my first official repo!
This is my first official SPA that I've created from scratch, including setting up webpack and babel.

My project uses a multitude of tools, and adheres to the Airbnb Style Guides.

As of now, this project remains incomplete. It has the essentials of an Express server and can be hosted via localhost, however it has not been deployed. What this project mainly highlights is my growth in React, Javascript, and Vanilla CSS.
